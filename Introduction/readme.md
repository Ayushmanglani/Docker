## Problem Statement: "Application works on My System ðŸ˜•!!"

## Why Docker?
 - Docker packs Code, libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package, this makes application run on any system easy. Apps are packaged into containers that can be run on any Operating System. 

## What is Docker?
 - A set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 
 - Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
 - Docker is:
   - Software Development platform to deploy apps
   - Docker is a client side application Program
   - Docker can also work as a service, which can be deployed on any server
   - Can act as a social Platform, where people can share their docker Images 

## What are Benefits of Docker?
 - Applications <b>run the same</b>, regardless of where they run.
 -	<b>No compatibility Issues</b> with Applications.
 - Dockers make bhavior of applications <b>Predictable</b>.
 - Docker makes developer to do <b>Less Work</b>.
 - Docker based apps are <b>Easier to maintain & deploy</b>.
 - Works with <b>any language, any Operating System, any technology</b>.
 
## How Docker Works? 

![How Docker Works](https://github.com/Ayushmanglani/Docker/blob/master/Introduction/howdockerworks.png)

 - Developer Creates a Docker File which contains information about <b>Operation System Information, dependencies, Application code, etc</b>.
 - This Dockerfile is then <b>built into a docker Image</b>, which can be <b>pushed to Docker hub</b>.
 - This Docker Image can be <b>pulled</b> on to any system from Docker hub and made to <b>Run as a Container</b>.
