## Why Docker?
 - Docker packs Code, libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package, this makes application run on any system easy.  
 - Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 
 - Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
